# Deep Learning Prerequisites: Logistic Regression in Python 

Provides you with many practical examples so that you can really see how deep learning can be used on anything. Throughout the course, we'll do a course project, which will show you how to predict user actions on a website given user data like whether or not that user is on a mobile device, the number of products they viewed, how long they stayed on your site, whether or not they are a returning visitor, and what time of day they visited.
